//! This module defines a executable unit of work called a `Job`. Jobs are what
//! get scheduled on the thread-pool. After the are allocated, a reference
//! (specifically a `JobRef`) is queued, passed to a thread, end executed.
//!
//! This module defines two core job types: `StackJob` and `HeapJob`. The former
//! is more efficent, but can only be used when the work won't outlive the
//! current stack. `HeapJob` requires an allocation, but can outlive the current
//! stack.
//!
//! When using a job, one must be extreamly careful to ensure that:
//! (a) The job does not outlive anything it closes over.
//! (b) The job remains valid until it is executed for the last time.
//! (c) Each job reference is executed exactly once.
